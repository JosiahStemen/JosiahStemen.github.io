		<a name="about"></a>
			<p id="about">My name is Josiah Stemen, I am currently studying at Bethany High School. I have attended both Bethany Earl Harris Elementary and Bethany Middle School as I have progressed educationally. I have participated in many extracurricular activities such as band, jazz band, orchestra, the all-school musical, stage tech, robotics, equine volunteer work, National Honor Society, and many more. In my free time I enjoy playing saxophone and guitar, studying, listening to music (mostly big band and Billy Joel), watching documentaries, and enjoying the local cuisine.
